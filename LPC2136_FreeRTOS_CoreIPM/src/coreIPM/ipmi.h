	   of the possible event offset values. Each bit in the mask corresponds
	   to a different offset values starting with bit 0 in the mask 
	   corresponding to offset 0. For example, if it is desired to have a

/* System Software use of Sensor Scanning bits & Entity Info
System software must ignore any sensor that has the sensor scanning bit 
disabled - if system software didn�t disable the sensor. This provides an 
alternate mechanism to allow the management controller to automatically
adjust the sensor population without requiring a corresponding change of the
sensor data records. For example, suppose the management controller has a way
of automatically knowing that a particular temperature sensor will be absent in
a given system configuration if a given processor is also absent. The management
controller could elect to automatically disable scanning for that temperature 
sensor. System management software would ignore that sensor even if it was 
reported in the SDRs.

Note that this is an alternate mechanism that may be useful in some circumstances.
The primary mechanism is to use the Entity ID information in the SDRs, and combine
that information with presence detection for the entity.

If there is a presence detection sensor for a given entity, then system management
software should ignore all other sensors associated with that entity. Some sensors
have intrinsic support for this. For example, a sensor-specific Processor sensor 
has a �Processor Presence� bit. If that bit is implemented, and the processor is
absent, any other sensors and non-presence related bits associated with that 
processor can be ignored. If the sensor type doesn�t have an intrinsic presence
capability, you can implement an �Entity Presence� sensor. This sensor solely 
reports whether a given Entity is present or not.

possible for the controller to receive and process a �Get Sensor
Reading� or �Get Sensor Event Status� command for the sensor
before the update has completed. This is most likely to be the
case for sensors, such as fan RPM sensors, that may require
seconds to accumulate the first reading after a re-arm. The bit
is also used to indicate when a reading/state is unavailable
because the management controller cannot obtain a valid
reading or state for the monitored entity, typically because the
entity is not present. See Section 16.4, Event Status, Event
Conditions, and Present State and Section 16.6, Re-arming for
more information. */

This section based on - IPMI - Platform Management FRU Information
Storage Definition document v1.0
Document Revision 1.1
September 27, 1999

The FRU Information is used to primarily to provide �inventory� information
about the boards that the FRU Information Device is located on. It is a goal 
that all major field replaceable units (FRUs) have an EEPROM or FRU Information 
Device from which, at a minimum, the part number or version number can be read
through software. It is also a goal that the FRUs serial number be software 
readable.

The format divides the FRU Information Device (or EEPROM) into six different 
areas:

1) Common Header
The Common Header is mandatory for all FRU Information Device implementations. 
It holds version information for the overall information format specification 
and offsets to the other information areas. The other areas may or may not be 
present based on the application of the device. An area is specified as �Null�
or �not present� when the Common Header has a value of 00h for the starting 
offset for that area.

2) Internal Use Area
This area provides private, implementation-specific information storage for
other devices that exist on the same FRU as the FRU Information Device. The
Internal Use Area is usually used to provide private non-volatile storage for a
management controller.

3) Chassis Info Area 
This area is used to hold Serial Number, Part Number, and other information
about the system chassis. A system can have multiple FRU Information Devices
within a chassis, but only one device should provide the Chassis Info Area.
Thus, this area will typically be absent from most FRU Information Devices.
Ideally this information is in a FRU device that is part of a board that is
associated with the chassis, such as a front panel or power distribution board.
But many systems, particularly low-end systems, do not incorporate such
locations. Therefore, it is common to find the Chassis Info Area included in the
FRU information for the baseboard.

4) Board Info Area 
This area provides Serial Number, Part Number, and other information about
the board that the FRU Information Device is located on.

5) Product Info Area
This area is present if the FRU itself is a separate product. This is typically
seen when the FRU is an add-in card. When this area is provided in the FRU
Information Device that contains the Chassis Info Area, the product info is for
the overall system, as initially manufactured.

5) MultiRecord Info Area
The MultiRecord Info Area provides a region that holds one or more records
where the type and format of the information is specified in the individual
headers for the records. This differs from the other information areas, where
the type and format of the information are implied by which offset is used in
the Common Header. The MultiRecord Info Area provides a mechanism for
extending the FRU Information Specification to cover new information types
without impacting the existing area definitions.

The management controller provides Read/Write FRU Inventory Data commands for
accessing the nonvolatile storage contents via the controller�s messaging 
interface.
*/
/*
The Common Header area is the starting point for accessing FRU information data. 
The Common Header area always starts at offset 00h. The Common Header is present
for all FRU Information Devices in the system. The data in this header provides
the offsets to the other information areas in the device. A checksum is included
to allow the integrity of the header data to be verified.

The Chassis Info, Board Info, and Product Info areas each contain a number of 
variable length fields. Each of these fields is preceded by a type/length byte 
that indicates the length of the field and the type of encoding that is used for
the field. The leading fields in each area serve predefined functions. These 
fields can be followed by �custom� fields that are defined by manufacturing or
by the OEM. The same variable length field format is used within records in the
MultiRecord Area.

An application that accesses the information starts by verifying that the format
version information for the FRU Information Device is a version that the 
application supports. It does this be extracting the format version information 
from Common Header area. Next, the application extracts the starting offset for 
the desired area from the Common Header. The application then accesses the 
�header� information specified at the beginning of the area. If the area format 
version is correct, the application can proceed an access the data. (Note for 
the MultiRecord area, the Common Header offset points both the start of the area
and to the first Record in the MultiRecord area.)

Since the fields within an area (or Record) can be variable or fixed length, 
the application must �walk� the fields sequentially. The application traverses 
all fields by walking individual fields until the �end-of-fields� type/length 
byte (value C1h) is encountered. 
(Note: Only pre-defined fields are allowed to be fixed length without type/length
bytes. All custom fields are specified as variable length fields with type/length 
bytes.)

Each area/record starts with a fixed number of pre-defined fields. This is 
followed by a variable number of optional custom fields. If a field is not used,
a �NULL� or �Empty� version of the field is used as a placeholder. Thus, an 
application can rely on the Nth field as always having the same meaning. (Note:
this is guaranteed for pre-defined fields only.)

An application could present predefined fields with labels according to their 
function and formatted according to the �type� specified in the type/length field.
The application could present custom fields with a generic label (e.g. �Custom 
Field 1�) followed by the field data formatted according to the �type� specified
in the type/length field (e.g. Hex, ASCII, Binary).

Prior to using any FRU Information Data, an applications should validate the
checksum for the area or record.

the Board denies that it has control.
Release 0 = Ack
Shelf Manager requests the Board to Release control of the
resource and the Board acknowledges it will do so when
operations are complete. Bus is not available to be reassigned
until the Board sends a Relinquish message.
1 = Refused
Shelf Manager requests the Board to Release the resource and
the Board acknowledges control but cannot release the
resource without disrupting operations. Board does not release
control.
2 = No Control Shelf Manager requests the Board to Release the resource and
the Board denies that it has control.
Force 0 = Ack
Shelf Manager commands the Board to immediately relinquish
the resource and the Board acknowledges it must do so.
Receipt and acknowledgement of this command may trigger
additional application specific commands or actions needed to
release the bus. The Shelf Manager cannot reassign control of
the bus until the Board sends a Relinquish message.
1 = No Control Shelf Manager requests the Board to immediately relinquish the
resource and the Board denies that it has control.
Bus Free 0 = Accept
Shelf Manager informs the Board that the resource has become
free and may be taken by the Board and the Board accepts
control of the resource.
1 = Not Needed
Shelf Manager informs the Board that the resource has become
free, but the Board is not interested in controlling the resource
any longer.
Board to Shelf
Manager Request 0 = Grant Board requests and Shelf Manager grants control of the
resource to the Board.
1 = Busy
Board requests control but Shelf Manager knows the resource
is currently assigned to another Board. The Shelf Manager will
make a Release request to the Board currently in control of the
resource. The Board must try again later to see if it can get
access to the resource.
2 = Defer
Board requests control and the resource is assigned to another
Board. The Shelf Manager responds with Defer then it will send
a Bus Free message to the Board when the resource becomes
free at a later time. This allows the Board to skip the polling that
is required by the Busy response.
3 = Deny
Board requests and Shelf Manager denies (i.e., rejects) control
of the resource to the Board. In this case, the Shelf Manager
does not request the Board in control to release the resource.
Relinquish 0 = Ack Shelf Manager acknowledges that the Board relinquished
control of the bused resource and is no longer using the bus.
1 = Error
Shelf Manager acknowledges that the Board relinquished
control of the resource and is no longer using the bus, but the
Shelf Manager believes that the Board should not have been in
control of the resource. (Optional.)
Notify 0 = Ack Shelf Manager acknowledges that the Board now has control of
the bused resource.
1 = Error
Shelf Manager acknowledges that the Board now has control of
the bused resource, but the Shelf Manager believes that the
Board should not have been given control of the resource.
(Optional.)
2 = Deny
Shelf Manager denies (i.e., rejects) control of the resource by
the Board. In this case, the Board stops using the resource
immediately.
