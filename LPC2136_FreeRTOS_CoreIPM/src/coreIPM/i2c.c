/*
The LPC2141/2/4/6/8 I2C interfaces are byte oriented, and have four operating 
modes: master transmitter mode, master receiver mode, slave transmitter mode 
and slave receiver mode.

In a given application, the I2C block may operate as a master, a slave, or 
both. In the slave mode, the I2C hardware looks for its own slave address and 
the general call address. If one of these addresses is detected, an interrupt 
is requested. If the processor wishes to become the bus master, the hardware 
waits until the bus is free before the master mode is entered so that a 
possible slave operation is not interrupted. If bus arbitration is lost in the
master mode, the I2C block switches to the slave mode immediately and can 
detect its own slave address in the same serial transfer.

During a data transfer from a master transmitter to a slave receiver, the first
byte transmitted by the master is the slave address. Next follows a number of
data bytes. The slave returns an acknowledge bit after each received byte.

Before the master transmitter mode can be entered, the control register must 
be initialized. Control register bits are set by writing to I2C0CONSET/I2C1CONSET
and cleared by writing to I2CCONCLR/I2C1CONCLR registers.

- I2EN must be set to 1 to enable the I2C function. 
- If the AA bit is 0, the I2C interface will not acknowledge any address 
  when another device is master of the bus, so it can not enter slave mode. 
- The STA, STO and SI bits must be 0. The SI Bit is cleared by writing 1 to the
  SIC bit in the I2CONCLR register.

I2C0CONSET and I2C1CONSET used to configure Master mode
Bit     7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
Symbol  - I2EN STA STO SI  AA   -   -
Value   -   1   0   0   0   0   -   -

The first byte transmitted contains the slave address of the receiving device 
(7 bits) and the data direction bit. In this mode the data direction bit (R/W)
should be 0 which means Write. The first byte transmitted contains the slave 
address and Write bit. Data is transmitted 8 bits at a time. After each byte 
is transmitted, an acknowledge bit is received. START and STOP conditions are
output to indicate the beginning and the end of a serial transfer.

The I2C interface will enter master transmitter mode when software sets the
STA bit. The I2C logic will send the START condition as soon as the bus is 
free. After the START condition is transmitted, the SI bit is set, and the 
status code in the I2STAT register is 0x08. This status code is used to vector
to a state service routine which will load the slave address and Write bit to 
the I2DAT register, and then clear the SI bit. SI is cleared by writing a 1 to
the SIC bit in the I2CONCLR register.

When the slave address and R/W bit have been transmitted and an acknowledgment 
bit has been received, the SI bit is set again, and the possible status codes 
now are 0x18, 0x20, or 0x38 for the master mode, or 0x68, 0x78, or 0xB0 if the
slave mode was enabled (by setting AA to 1). The appropriate actions to be 
taken

/* General Call Handling
According to the i2c specification, the meaning of the general call address is
always specified in the second byte (first data byte after the address).

There are two cases to consider:
� When the least significant bit B is a �zero�.
� When the least significant bit B is a �one�.

When bit B is a �zero�; the second byte has the following definition:

� 00000110 (H�06�). Reset and write programmable part of slave address by hardware.
On receiving this 2-byte sequence, all devices designed to respond to the general
call address will reset and take in the programmable part of their address. 

� 00000100 (H�04�). Write programmable part of slave address by hardware. All 
devices which define the programmable part of their address by hardware (and
which respond to the general call address) will latch this programmable part
at the reception of this two byte sequence. The device will not reset.

� 00000000 (H�00�). This code is not allowed to be used as the second byte.

The remaining codes have not been fixed and devices must ignore them.

We ignore the bit B is a �zero� case.

When bit B is a �one�; the 2-byte sequence is a �hardware general call�. This
means that the sequence is transmitted by a hardware master device, such as a
keyboard scanner, which cannot be programmed to transmit a desired slave 
address. Since a hardware master doesn�t know in advance to which device the
message has to be transferred, it can only generate this hardware general call
and its own address - identifying itself to the system.

The seven bits remaining in the second byte contain the address of the hardware
master. This address is recognized by an intelligent device (e.g. a microcontroller)
connected to the bus which will then direct the information from the hardware 
master. If the hardware master can also act as a slave, the slave address is 
identical to the master address.

The IPMI spec indicates that the IPMB message format for the Broadcast Get Device
ID request exactly matches that for the Get Device ID command, with the exception
that the IPMB message is prefixed with the 00h broadcast address.
